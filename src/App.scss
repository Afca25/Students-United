@use './Styles/index' as *;

//===== GOOGLE FONT =====
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;600;700&display=swap');
// Remember to use _index.scss with @use 


// Thanks to this new live Sass compiler I installed (it's a fork of the most known one) I don't need to use @import './Styles/font';
